B06X14Z8JP,Don’t waste your money!!!,Horrible product!!! Hasn’t lasted 8 weeks! Battery does not hold a charge. Do Not Buy This Product!!!!
B06X14Z8JP,One Star,sound quality POOR
B06XYPJN4G,Great Technology but takes some practice to use properly,"I noticed some review stated the batteries only last a couple of hours per charge. That is not my experience and I've had mine for many months. One charge lasts many hours. I recently charged them and went to a family gathering 250 miles away and over an entire day they lasted perfectly, including driving back after the day long visit. WARNING: Some of the reviews shown here by Amazon are not reviews for the Bose Hearphones but instead are for regular Bose noise cancelling headphones. I gave these HEARPHONES five stars after my first use, but I mentioned that it was difficult to fit the ear buds. Now I have learned to fit them myself and I must withdraw that small criticism. I put them on today. drove to the market, did some shopping, drove home. I could have wonderfully clear conversation with the checker despite background in a very busy area. Then on the way home I turned on the car radio, which I never can hear properly even with my 3,000 dollar ""regular"" hearing aids. With the hearphones I could hear music on the car radio with pristine clarity and the sounds of the traffic around me was no problem. There is one small drawback, which is that the on/off switch is hidden from view when wearing them (the switch is on the neckpiece). The first day I used them I had a group of about a dozen people to relate to around a table. The result was far superior to my ordinary hearing aids, and the control through my cell phone app was excellent. The earbuds are not the sort you just press into your ear. Instead there are some curving cords connected to the earbuds which fit into the contour of your ear to keep the earbuds in place. It is tricky to learn to get them in properly but it can be done after a bit of practice. The reward is worth the effort!"
B06X14Z8JP,Broke after one use,Broke after one use! I expected more more from This company but they were cheaply made and your better off getting a pair at the dollar tree!
B06XYPJN4G,"This unit is basically ""throw away"" after the battery dies.",Bose tells me that the batteries are good for about 500 recharge cycles. Once the battery dies you have to buy a new unit. No provisions for battery replacement. This means you may need to replace the unit with a new one in less than 2 years if you use daily. Very sad - I LOVE these things.
B06XYPJN4G,"Trapped in an increasingly noisy world? These help, a lot.","I recently accepted the fact that age is taking its toll on my hearing. I haven't gone in for tests, but online tests show my hearing diminished in the upper ranges. the ladies in my life had already remarked that I asked them to repeat, way too often.I attended a business cocktail party at San Diego Comic Con. Lots of people, loud music, I couldn't understand anything being said. I'm a Bose fan, having tried almost all of their products. I own the QC30s...I sprung for these and I couldn't be happier. I bought them just in time for Gen Con. More loud music, more crowded rooms. These buds performed like champs.I'm still learning the adjustments. If I have both buds in during a noisy dinner, the fraction of a second time delay before I hear my voice is a little disconcerting. But I'm sure I will adapt.At home, I did not understand how much dialogue I was missing on TV.And, being Bose, they pair easily--be sure and get the app--and they sound great.I now have a hearing appointment, but dang these are nice. Dial down on the noise cancelling, and almost all of the background noise in a loud restaurant disappears. and comfort, I forget they're in my ears. Highly recommended."
B06XBT1R3S,Comparison to Bombas Socks review!,"Before I bought these, I scanned the reviews for a comparison to Bombas. I didn’t see any so I’m writing one for those who may be wondering. These are pretty good socks. I wear a size 9 and still find them slightly looser than my Bombas socks, but I haven’t washed them yet so that might change. My first impressions are, they are thinner than Bombas, but are just as comfy and sit slightly higher on the ankle, which I happen to like. I’ve attached pictures for comparison and for you to see how they sit in your shoes. Overall, I think if you’re looking for a comfortable sock, with arch support, these are a good deal."
B06XBT1R3S,These run very big,I was very excited when I ordered these socks. Usually socks give you a huge range like these and they still fit very small feet. These socks are really big. I usually wear size 5-6 shoe. I am not able to wear these socks with my running shoes.
B06XBT1R3S,I can't praise these enough,"They're very similar to Balega's hidden comfort socks, but they're much cheaper. I don't run long distances, so perhaps Balega's may be better in those instances. These are my favorite socks. They don't slip down in the shoes, but they're not too high on the ankle. I really can't praise these enough. They're incredibly comfortable! I wore them in warmer weather (70-80 degrees) and cooler weather (50-55 degrees), and I was comfortable in both. They may be too thick for any hotter than 80 though."
B07JHPTN6Z,Died after two months,"I bought this for distance running and initially they were great; good sound quality, good connection, and comfortable to use. They held up great during my long runs earlier in the year, but after my first long run in relatively warm weather of the year (21 miles, 70 degrees yesterday) I think sweat killed these. They no longer charge or connect to my phone, and while they can power on and off there is a constant feedback buzz sound when they are on. Incredibly disappointing that they failed so soon and not even in that hot of weather, so it wasn't like there was an excessive amount of sweat.These may be good for the gym or light workouts where you won't be sweating too much, but for anything intensive I suspect they won't last very long."
B07JHPTN6Z,Nice battery life.,Well the first time I charged and used it seemed to last considerably long over a two day period so the second time I charged them for used I began in the beginning of my shift so I could start a timer to determine just how long continuous use would provide me. 7 hours 14 minutes 23 seconds. That is with sound constantly streaming between phone calls and audio books. I will be curious how degradation occurs over the next few weeks or months. Updates coming soon!Update: 7hrs 31min now in February of nearly continual YouTube and audible.com usage. I use 6 days a week and it is still holding a charge excellently 2 months in.
B07JHPTN6Z,"Great sound, wonderful comfort and fit, and a great price.","This was such a pleasant surprise. I had been having bad luck with fitness bluetooth ear buds. I had a pair from a brand that was the same as my wired ones that were amazing in the areas of comfort/fit, sound, and value. The BT earbuds from that company had decent sound, decent fit, but they cut out constantly. That drove me nuts. I returned them, and tried another brand that were even worse. I tried these because they were similar to the style of my wired earbuds (I like the memory wire, in-ear monitor style) and I am happy to say that these Fit Sport 3's have so far met and exceeded all my expectations. They sound amazing with all the bass you could want without overpowering the mids and highs (although there is an EQ setting you could choose if you wanted to have the bassier sound), and the fit and comfort are perfect for me. They dont hurt my ears at all (in fact, the comfort and locked-in fit of these with the silicon ear fins are wonderful) and they dont even start to fall out. I'm on day 3 with these, and if things go south in quality, I'll revise this review, but to be honest, I will probably contact customer service first and have them send me another pair, because these are the BT earbuds I have been looking for. And they were 20 bucks less than the others! Can't wait to get outside and jog a bit to really put these thru the paces. If there is one flaw I have in the design, it would be that the cord is a little too long, but that is just personal taste. But I am really stretching to find a flaw in these."
B0756CYWWD,I give it five stars. My wife hates them ...,I give it five stars. My wife hates them she would give it 1. I put them on and that’s it. I can’t hear her any more.
B0756CYWWD,Great sound quality and amazing noise cancellation,"I purchased these and the Sony WH1000XM2 to compare the two. Cnet says they both have a ""9"" for sound quality. I would agree, they both sound excellent. The Bose won the test for its noise cancellation, performance talking to people on the phone, comfort on my head, and sound processing.Phone performance:I compared how the Bose and the Sony sounded when recording and playing back my voice with a fan running in the background. The Bose sounded like I was holding an old fashioned handset and talking in a quiet room - intimate and zero background noise. The Sony sounded like I was on speaker phone, and I could hear some background noise. (As a control I also recorded using neither and it sounded like I was on speaker but also I could hear more background noise.) This feature is important to me since I spend a lot of time on the phone and prefer my clients to not hear any background noise.Sound qualityThe Bose and Sony both have excellent sound quality for playing music. I personally prefer the sound the Sony produces. The Sony iphone app lets you choose your levels on an equalizer, and I like that. However, the Bose hears what type of music you're playing and automatically optimizes the sound, and it does a really good job. While I would prefer to be able to set the levels if I so choose, I also appreciate that Bose is making it all easy for me, so I can truly listen to my music on random and not have to fuss with levels. The Bose iphone app doesn't do very much at all. It does let you ""find your headset"" similar to the ""find my phone"" app, and it will apply firmware. (I'm hoping Bose will add an equalizer into its app in the future.)Noise cancellationThe Sony occasionally made me aware that noise cancellation was going on (with a whitenoise effect). The Bose on the other hand just stops the noise. There is no delay, no white noise, just quiet and your music.ControlsThe Bose controls are intuitive to find and to use. I like that the on-off control is a switch to flip on and off (rather than a button to find). Also, you can use this button to switch between devices, for example between your phone and ipad and your TV amplifier. The right earcup has three small buttons in a row together, and they control a lot of things. Volume, pause, and skip, rewind, answer/decline calls, etc. The left earcup only has the google assistant button, which I programmed to instead control the amount of noise cancellation (high, low, off). Song playback sounds much better with noise cancellation on high, and I don't think that has to do with noise (I was in a quiet environment); the bass sounds enhanced with noise cancellation on for some reason. (In comparison, the Sony lets you swipe the earcup itself to control volume, pause, play, skip, etc. This seems great in theory, but in practice if I bumped the earcup adjusting my glasses or whatever, the music would pause. I found the Sony to be somewhat buggy in that regard. It would stop playing at times and I had to pick up my phone to get the music re-started, which is annoying.) I found the Bose controls to be more intuitive and consistent. Also, when you switch them on a voice tells you how much battery you have left, which is handy.ComfortThe Bose QuietComfort truly is comfortable. The earcups are soft, there is not a lot of clamping, and the top band is padded so it's less annoying on the top of the head. (In comparison, the Sony do have more clamping which was uncomfortable over glasses.) I am a pilot and wear a similar headset, so I'm familiar with how headphones feel after a few hours. On-ear are not going to be as comfortable for long term wear as earbuds would be, but I was wiling to make that trade-off to get superior sound quality.StyleThe Bose are more streamlined to my head. the Sony are bulky and look geeky.ConclusionEven though the Sony produces superior sound, the litany of other features (superior noise cancellation, intuitive controls, comfort, style, & phone performance) won me over to the Bose."
B0756CYWWD,Can even noise-cancel-out a chatty Marketing Department!!!,"These are amazing and Bose is great! I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities. I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted. I don't even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department. I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients. The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well. Battery life is extremely good. I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset. It comes with an 1/8"" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead. An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time. This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device. It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn't function. Bose support was difficult to deal with. At first the support technician didn't think there was anything wrong with the headset. After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer. This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks. The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall. I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there. After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set. No other questions asked. He just said ""We like to take care of our customers"". I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out."
B07289ZZVL,Well they sound great look good,Well they sound great look good. But it's been 1 month and then quit charging and quit working right in the middle of a conversation with my boss. Try charging after one day maybe they got to hot. After 3 days still didn't work.
B07289ZZVL,Stopped working,Headset was 11 months old when the left earbud stopped working. Talked with Amazon customer service. They were very courteous and explained I needed to go to the manufacturer for warranty work. I have been down this road before with my wife's headset. After sending the wrong product we had a total of 6 weeks and several phone calls invested in getting it replaced. I decided it was easier to change to a vendor with a higher rating than put up with the aggravation of trying to make a claim for the warranty.
B07289ZZVL,This is junk. Left ear piece does not work ...,"This is junk. Left ear piece does not work ... already. Will have to return. Do not buy, cheaply made."
B087NHB75D,Made with Alexa built in.,"Never got to use them. No where in the Amazon description did it say ""ALEXA BUILT IN"". It's made to listen to you. No thanks. The interconnectivity of Alexa makes me uncomfortable generally. The fact that it's constantly collecting data on me to profit from later. That's a massive deal breaker for me personally. Returning it as soon as I saw the box."
B087NHB75D,Overall Review + Comparison to Jaybird Vista (and others),"I'm an earbud geek, probably a product of both working out frequently (running + cycling) and from working at home while wrangling small kids. I've primarily used a pair of truly wireless Jaybird Vista earbuds as my favorite blend of good for workouts plus 'good enough' for phone calls for the last year... though I also have a pair of Bose wired earbuds (SoundSport), Bowers & Wilkins P13 wired earbuds, plus a few much cheaper off brand pairs that I'll sometimes grab for phone calls. These Sony WF-SP800N are my new favorite earbuds across the board.SETUP & SONY APP: Fine -- but nothing to write home about. I initially followed the instructions which tells you to open the Sony Headphone app and pair the earbuds there, but while the app saw the earbuds, it gave an error trying to pair them to my phone. Ignoring the instructions and just pairing them the normal way through my phone's bluetooth setting worked immediately and the connection since has been very strong (no drops, and good consistent connection even when I leave my phone downstairs and go upstairs to grab something). Overall the Sony app is ok; it allows for some sound mix customization and has more features than the Jaybird earbud app, but that's a low bar (the Jaybird app is truly bad). The one feature in the Sony app is that's particularly cool is that you can set a baseline amount of ambient noise for different activities: sitting, walking, running, and commute. Since I have young (read: noisy) kids at home, I put the ambient sound control level higher than the usual default for sitting. You do have to enable location detection in order for the earbuds to decide whether you're sitting/running/etc -- or at a location like the gym where you can also specify custom setting by location -- so for those with privacy concerns, you might turn off location detection and thus lose those features. One slight knock on these earbuds is that you can pair bluetooth to multiple devices, but you have to manually switch connections so there isn't a multi-point connection option.CONTROLS: Mostly very good. I love that the left and right earbuds can be independently set to cover different areas of control, i.e. as an example you can set one earbud to switch between Ambient Sound Control on/off and Noise Cancelling on/off while the other earbud controls music (pause, forward, back, etc). Besides being able to choose separate controls for each earbud, there are also a lot of types of controls you can assign through the app: Ambient Sound Control, Playback Control, Volume Control, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or none. The only thing that keeps these from being excellent is a personal preference, but it annoys me a bit that the controls are activated by brushing your finger on the earbud's control area, you don't actually push a button in. Once in awhile if I adjust my long hair to be out of my face or to pull it back, or am sweaty during exercise and towel off my face, my hands will brush the earbuds and trigger the controls. Not a deal breaker for me since it doesn't happen often, but it's one area where I prefer my Jaybird Vistas since they have an actual button you depress to trigger the controls. There are also a couple default controls that I found a little annoying and turned off in the app: example, if you remove an earbud it pauses the music automatically. All of those features are easy to turn on/off in the app though, so overall the flexibility of controls is excellent, with the control sensitivity being the only ""un-fixable"" annoyance.SOUND: The sound on these Sony earbuds is excellent overall and fantastic when compared to other truly wireless earbuds. They're nearly as good as a pair of over-ear Master & Dynamic MW65 earphones we have that are much more expensive ($499). I don't think any wireless earbuds can truly best over-ear headphones, but these come close. I thought the sound on my Jaybird Vistas was very good, but the Sonys have a better sound blend and also enable you to simply hear better because of the Ambient & Noise Cancelling features (neither of which the Jaybird Vistas have). The Noise Cancelling is excellent for earbuds, but it isn't perfect; if you're frequently on an airplane and want super strong noise cancelling, then I'd recommend some other options for over-ear headphones (or some of the wired earbuds like Bowers & Wilkins PI3 which is a similar price point to these Sonys; the noise cancelling is better on the B&W, but they have heavy cord controls and don't work at all for exercise). For wireless earbuds that pair functionality with overall excellent sound, the Sonys are the best I've come across. Phone calls also have very good sound, and I've had zero issues with dropped calls so far.COMFORT & BATTERY: I love the fit of these. My ears do best with earfins, which Jaybird Vista also has. This might not be for everyone, but it's the only type I've found that will stay flawlessly in my ears during sweaty workouts. These are a bit bigger in size than my Jaybirds but feel light and comfortable in my ears, and stayed in fine even during intense workouts running outside and on our Peloton. The battery is also very good. In theory the earbuds have 9 hours of playback with noise cancelling on and 13 without -- mine didn't last quite that long, which is understandable since I was frequently using the music controls, but I got close to 8 hours with noise cancelling on. The case provides another full charge worth of battery life. The case itself is frankly not amazing. It's bulky, considerably larger than the jaybird vista case, and is a weird oblong shape that doesn't fit comfortably in any sort of pocket.OVERALL: In any one category (noise cancelling, sound, battery life) you could probably find another brand that performs a bit better in that single category. But for truly wireless earbuds that are utility players across all the categories, these are my favorite by far. I find myself reaching for these for multi-hour Zoom work sessions as well as tough workouts or just around the house while I do chores. Great overall functionality and a nice value at the price point."
B087NHB75D,The leader in wireless buds - Pure Joy compared to the WF-1000XM3.,"I have the WH-1000XM3 and the WF-1000MX3. The left bud of my 10-month old WF-1000XM3 gave up and so I sent it back for an exchange. But I didn't want to be without a wireless bud for a month? So I have read about these newish WF-SP800N and decided I'll get it. Here are the highlights:FitFar superior to the 1000XMs which is just 'perched' on your ears, these SP800Ns fit me like a glove. I had been benefiting from the commute time savings of work-from-home and have been indulging in a no of home improvement tasks. With the 1000XMs, I had either bud fall out inexplicably, into the floor, dirt, grass, hard cement too many times to count. And I had it fitted with the largest bud (for a tighter fit and great sound isolation). There were a few occasions where I had to look for a dropped bud in the debris.For the past two days since I got the SP800Ns, I have exposed them to the ultimate test. I have been on the roof, on the top of my patio, high on the ladder, with both gloved hands full of paint and they NEVER fell off. I would never have attempted this with the 1000XMs. Moreover, it has been 100 deg heat and I've been drenched in sweat which would have been worrisome with the non-sweat proof 1000XMs.However, that said, the largest earbuds of the SP800Ns have stayed behind in my ears on two removal occasions. They are somewhat easier to come off. I tried the next smaller sized tip but I'll lose the sound isolation as well as a significant decrease in bass from the looser fit.Sound QualityEx-audiophile here though my days of critical listening are quite over. If the WF-1000XM3 sounded better, you've got me fooled. I say the SP800Ns are just as good if not better. It FITS better, the bass is stronger which also helps to isolate external noise. I could not say that the NC is any worse but in fact thought it better than the 1000XMs. And just like the 1000XMs, no LDAC support with the SP800N either.OthersIt's a win here with splash-proof, longer battery life, greater bass and more importantly, better fit.DrawbacksI had 8 pairs of BT wireless head and earphones. My top two are now the WH-1000XM3 and these SP800Ns. I only have 1 pair of ears.ConclusionEver since I moved up from the lower-cost BT earphones, Jabra, Earpeats, Motorola, AKGs and a bunch others to the costlier Sonys, I've never looked back. Now, aside from the sofa-locked and earmuff-sized WH-1000XM3, the SP800Ns are now my go to head/earphones for both indoor and outdoor. Heck, one can even take a nap with these they are that comfortable."
B079H151BB,Ok but NC needs enhancement.,Ok sound but terrible noise cancelation. I don’t even think it works at all.
B079H151BB,Working through wire connection without charging.,"Nice headphones, comfortable and long lasting."
B079H151BB,"Great for ""easy listening"". Not working out",Only issue I have is it doesn't stay on my head while I do certain excersise when working out
B07N9BJT4R,"Great headphones, 'Medium size' donuts",I like the sound. High sensitivity for headphones in this price range. Others complain about sound quality or EQ. I had some issues; but tested on different apps. The problems turned out to be the app sound itself. Other headphones just didn't pick it up.I primarily use these plugged in to the phone or PC. These get a bit more volume than others in those low power situations.The CONS... My gigantic ear shapes just barely fit in the over-ear donuts. That's deeply personal info so sorry to offend anyone. But you know what they say about guys with big ears. They have a difficult time finding comfortable headphones.
B07N9BJT4R,En tiempo y Calidad,Muy buenos gracias amazon
B07N9BJT4R,Not Good,"They have an exaggerated low end, which is boomy and unmusical. Maybe with an equalizer you could track with these. As far as ""monitoring"" to get an accurate picture of your mix, forget it."
